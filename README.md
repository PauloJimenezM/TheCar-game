# The Car-game

![](TheCar.PNG)

My first c++ project - a simple car game.

This repository contains a simple game using c++ and a library mainly aimed at video games called Allegro. The game is about a car that must survive against the obstacles on the road. The car can destroy the obstacles by using a built-in weapon. In addition, the game presents a dashboard of the car with important information such as energy, speed, distance traveled, obstacles destroyed, nitro, among others.
